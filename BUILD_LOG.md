## 2026-08-13 — Size filter: tag bypass, one-line row, numeric only

**Root cause of the dead filter:** `filter.v.option.size` is silently ignored unless
the Size filter is enabled in Search & Discovery. The URL is accepted and the product
count never moves (`?filter.v.option.size=46` → 100 of 100), whereas
`?filter.v.availability=1` → 100 → 95. So the pills were decorative.

**Bypass, verified working:** Shopify's built-in tag routes filter server-side with no
app at all — measured on this store: `/collections/all` 100 → `/collections/all/elbow-sleeves`
6 → `/collections/all/short-sleeves` 2.

**Size now resolves in three tiers** (`sections/vamas-collection.liquid`), upgrading itself
as each becomes available:
1. native `size_filter` from Search & Discovery
2. `size-NN` product tags via tag routes — real filtering today
3. the `size_list` setting as inert placeholders

Picking a size keeps any sleeve/neckline tag already active, and a script re-attaches
`filter.*` query params that a tag path would otherwise drop.

**Numeric sizes only.** The catalogue splits exactly 50/50: 50 products carry numeric
sizes (32–50), the other 50 carry **only** M/L/XL/XXL on their SIZE option — old import
data for sizes Vamas does not sell. All three tiers filter to numeric values via
`| times: 1` (returns 0 for non-numeric). Those 50 products cannot be size-filtered at
all until their SIZE option is changed to numbers — listed in `products-with-letter-sizes.txt`.

**Size row layout**
- Phone: one scrolling line with every size, `+N` removed (15 pills, 756px scroll width
  in a 375px viewport, page overflow 0). The active pill is scrolled into view on load.
- Desktop sidebar: still one line with `+N`. Fixed a bug where the fit loop measured
  while the label still read `+0`; the real `+12` was wider and pushed a pill onto a
  second line. Tightened the sidebar pills too — 2 → 4 sizes visible.

**Handed over:** `size-tags-import.csv` (50 products, 334 size tags, existing tags
preserved — verified against two independent endpoints that untagged products really
are untagged, so the import will not wipe anything).

**Blocked:** writing the tags needs the Shopify connector, which asks for re-auth that
this session cannot complete.

## 2026-08-13 — Tablet view (769–1024px) site-wide

**Ask:** "pure website ka tab view bhi theek karo, acheses dikhe per desktop or phone ko kuch mat karna"

**Root cause:** Three files declared their tablet media query with no whitespace —
`@media(min-width:769px)and(max-width:1024px)`. That form is invalid CSS and never
matches, so every tablet rule in those files was dead code. Proven in-browser:

```
matchMedia('(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px)') -> true
matchMedia('(min-width:769px)and(max-width:1024px)')     -> false
```

**Changed**
- `assets/vamas-cart.css:147`, `assets/vamas-theme.css:1149`, `assets/vamas-product.css:289` — fixed the media query whitespace, reviving the existing tablet rules.
- `assets/vamas-theme.css` — new tablet block: header link/icon tightening, homepage rails 4-up → 3-up, hero copy widths, section padding.
- `assets/vamas-collection.css` — sidebar 200 → 168px, grid gap 20 → 14px, body padding 32 → 24px.

**Measured at 819px (834 device)**

| Page | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | 152px overflow; info column 47px | 0 overflow; gallery + info 755px, stacked |
| All pages (header) | ~88px overflow; nav needs 941px in a 723px bar | 0 overflow; icons end at 787px |
| Homepage rails | 4.4 cards/view | 3.1 cards/view (236px cards) |
| Collection | 161px cards, 200px sidebar | 173px cards, 168px sidebar |
| Cart | `335px 360px` — summary ≈ cart | `427px 300px` |
| Contact | — | 0 overflow (only a hidden off-screen toast) |

**Also:** removed a `.vamas-nav__contact-btn { display: none }` tablet rule that never
applied — `.vamas-nav__icons > a` (0,1,1) outranks it (0,1,0). The nav fits with the
button showing, so the rule went rather than gaining specificity it did not need.

**Regression checks:** 1024px → tablet MQ true, 0 overflow, 236px cards. 1280px desktop
→ sidebar 240, 4-up grid, gap 20, contact button visible, 0 overflow. 375px phone →
2-up grid, gap 10, contact hidden, 0 overflow. Desktop and phone untouched, as asked.

**Verification method:** DOM property reads (`getBoundingClientRect`, `getComputedStyle`,
`scrollWidth`) and `matchMedia`, not screenshots — the screenshot tool in this
environment renders stale frames after JS-driven DOM mutation.

**Commits:** tablet media-query fix + `Tablet: widen collection cards, drop the dead contact-btn hide rule`
